## OccamBSD: An application of Occam's razor to FreeBSD
a.k.a. "super svelte stripped down FreeBSD"

This project incorporates several inter-related scripts with the broad goal of producing purpose-build FreeBSD systems:

mirror-upstream.sh	Creates and maintains a local git.freebsd.org repository with releng, stable, and main branches
bos-lite.sh		Launched by mirror-upstream.sh and performs an inverse "build option survey"
bos-upload.sh		Launched by bos-lite.sh if present for uploating to a web server (not included)
build-option-smoke-test.sh	A build option CI test proposed to the FreeBSD cluster aministration team
occambsd.sh		Builds a "svelte", purpose-build FreeBSD bootable disk image using the FreeBSD build(7) system
profile-minimum.txt	A minimum system configuration for use on a virtual machine
profile-zfs.txt		The minimum configuration with ZFS added
profile-hardware.txt	A minimum configuration with ZFS and hardware machine support, tested on a ThinkPad
profile-ipv4.txt	The hardware profile plus minimum IPv4 networking
imagine.sh		Images official and OccamBSD bootable disk images to hardware and virtual machine images
rc.local.sh		An experimental stand-alone or /etc/rc.local script that configures FreeBSD system in an idempotent manner

## New Approach

Earlier version of OccamBSD handcrafted bootable UFS and ZFS disk images but the introduction of 'makefs -t zfs' allows it to use the upstream "VM-IMAGE" release syntax. This change has resulted in a reduction/delay of some features, but reduces the script from over 1100 lines to under 400. While the raw "VM-IMAGE" is intended for virtualization use, it is a full-featured boot image with a full userland and kernel that is compatible with most amd64 hardware.

## Motivations

FreeBSD Jail has long provided a lightweight container for services and applications. Internet-facing services are by definition at risk of remote abuse of the service and/or the operating system hosting them. A "minimum" Jail or virtual machine can theoretically contain only the dependencies to deliver the desired service, and nothing more, reducing the attack surface. In practice, FreeBSD offers a flexible build system with which build options (man src.conf) and kernel configuration options can significantly reduce the kernel and userland of a tailor-build system, rather than using the standard "buildworld". Furthermore, recent progress with "reproducible builds" can guarantee that stock components remain stock. Unfortunately, the supported build option have been inconsistent in their reliability up until the 13.0 release of FreeBSD.

The OccamBSD approach can provide:

* Validation of the FreeBSD build system and its build options
* The foundation for embedded projects and products
* An academic tour of the essential components of FreeBSD that are used by virtually all users at all times
* An inventory of the essential components of FreeBSD that must be prioritized for security auditing, quality assurance, and documentation
* An opportunity to review what's left after a "userland" build for consideration of removal from base
* Hopefully the foundation for an update mechanism to replace freebsd-update based on lessons from the up.bsd.lv proof of concept
* To be determined: The relationship of this to "packaged base"; the Makefile hygiene related to this should prove useful

In short, to help deliver on the FreeBSD promise to provide a flexible, permissively-licensed operating system for use for nearly any purpose.

## Requirements

mirror-upstream.sh:		Internet access, ZFS, git
bos-lite.sh			FreeBSD source and object directories
bos-upload.sh			Depends on your upload strategy
occambsd.sh:			FreeBSD 13.0 or later, and late 2022 FreeBSD 14-CURRENT for 'makefs -t zfs' support
imagine.sh:			Internet access if using images from ftp.freebsd.org
build-option-smoke-test.sh	FreeBSD source and object directories, optional git for metadata
rc.local.sh			A FreeBSD userland

## Output Layout

```
/b/				"Build" mount point for mirror-upstream.sh
/tmp/occambsd/OCCAMBSD		OccamBSD kernel configuration file
/tmp/occambsd/all_modules.txt	Generated list of all available kernel modules
/tmp/occambsd/all_options.conf	Generated list of all available build options
/tmp/occambsd/bhyve-boot.sh	Script to boot the resulting image under bhyve
/tmp/occambsd/xen-boot.sh	Script to boot the resulting image under Xen
/tmp/occambsd/bhyve-cleanup.sh Script to destroy the bhyve VM remnants
/tmp/occambsd/xen-cleanup.sh	Script to destroy the Xen VM remnants
/tmp/occambsd/logs		World, Kernel, and VM-IMAGE build logs

/tmp/occambsd/vm.raw		A copy of the generated VM image from /usr/obj
/tmp/occambsd/disc1.iso		A copy of the generated disk1.iso from /usr/obj
/tmp/occambsd/cfg		Xen VM configuration file
/root/imageine-work		Working directory for some imagine.sh operations
```

## Usage

Most of these scripts are position independent unless they depend on one another.

occambsd.sh requires a profile and can build a root-on-ZFS image with -z:


```
sh occambsd.sh -z -p profile-zfs.txt
```

The full occambsd.sh usage is:

```
-p <profile file> (required)
-s <source directory override>
-o <object directory override>
-w (Reuse the previous world build)
-k (Reuse the previous kernel build)
-g (Use the GENERIC kernel)
-z (Create ZFS image)
```

occambsd.sh will prompt to launch imagine.sh but it can be used indepenently:

```
sh imagine.sh
```

imagine.sh downloads a FreeBSD official release, stable, or current "VM-IMAGE", or a custom-build vm.raw image and assists with configuring it as a virtual machine disk image or images it to a hardware device for hardware boot.

Note that this requires use of the /media mount point, administrative privileges, and it creates /root/imagine-work for use for downloaded artifacts.


mirror-upstream.sh is hard-coded to use zpool "zroot" but that can be overridden with by appending a zpool name:

```
sh mirror-upstream.sh tank
```

rc.local.sh will prompt for a root destination directory, or will auto-execute on boot if renamed "/etc/rc.local" (remove .sh)

```
sh rc.local.sh
```

Read EXACTLY what it is doing and configure it to your needs. Modify, comment out, or delete sections as needed.

## build(7) Notes

FreeBSD is traditionally built as a "world" userland and a kernel with "make buildworld" and "make buildkernel" respectively. These are installed to a destination directory "DESTDIR" that can be the build host itself, a jail root directory, a mounted machine boot image, or release directories for packing as "distribution sets" for use by bsdinstall(8), the default FreeBSD installer. The "make vm-image" build target produces .qcow2, .raw, .vhd, and .vmdk boot images and does not require intermediary distribution sets. See:

## Related Tools and Prior Art

NanoBSD (nanobsd(8) and /usr/src/tools/tools/nanobsd/) is a "utility used to create a FreeBSD system image suitable for embedded applications" that produces a flashable disk image that can have one or more additional boot partitions for upgrading and fallback. A FreeBSD 13.0R build of NanoBSD consumes 2.7G of disk space per boot partition, representing a full installation of FreeBSD. Using NanoBSD with FreeBSD 13.0R requires a larger default image size and note that it defaults to 'make -j 3'. A NanoBSD installation can be reduced using KERNCONF and src.conf entries. Consider these changes to ~/nanobsd/defaults.sh:
```
NANO_PMAKE="make -j $(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)"
NANO_MEDIASIZE=16000000
```

picobsd (formerly referred to as PicoBSD) was located in /usr/src/release/picobsd and appears to have been removed from FreeBSD 13.0R. It can be found in the 12.X and earlier sources, and is unique in that it includes custom utilities.

TinyBSD (/usr/src/tools/tools/tinybsd) is focused on minimization of a FreeBSD installation but is not compatible with recent FreeBSD. TinyBSD uses seven template files, bridge, firewall, vpn, wrap, default, minimal, and wireless, which each have a dedicated kernel configuration file named TINYBSD, plus a list of all binaries to be copied in to the target image named tinybsd.basefiles. TinyBSD supports a list of desired ports, and support files like /etc/fstab and /etc/rc.conf. By contrast, OccamBSD uses either 'make installworld' or selective 'make install' for the installation of binaries.

[Crochet](https://github.com/freebsd/crochet) is a a relatively-recent image builder designed to "Build FreeBSD images for Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, PandaBoard, and others." Its functionality may be partly replaced by the official ~/src/release tools.

[Poudriere image.sh](https://github.com/freebsd/poudriere/blob/master/src/share/poudriere/image.sh) is an actively-developed framework for image generation that is well documented as part of the [BSD Router Project](https://bsdrp.net/documentation/technical_docs/poudriere?s[]=build) A Poudriere image installation can be reduced using KERNCONF and src.conf entries.

[mkjail](https://github.com/mkjail/mkjail) can be used on FreeBSD to create new jails, keep them updated, and upgrade to a new release.

Was Î¼bsd a thing?

## Observations

There are (and have been) many FreeBSD build tools but few, with the notable exception of TinyBSD, have made any effort to "minimize" the FreeBSD kernel and/or base system with any effort beyond a kernel configuration file and a src.conf file. This is understandable, given that the FreeBSD build options have been under-maintained for decades. FreeBSD 13.0-RELEASE marks an important milestone with the quality of its build options.
